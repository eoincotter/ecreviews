            <h1> About the Website </h1>
			<p> My motivation for the theme of this website was my view that smart devices, particularly smartphones, are taking over our lives in a negative way. I also believe that smart devices, given the ubiquity and democratisation of information that they provide, have great potential to empower oneself through self-growth and development, however this potential is not being reached. This website has two main sections - Blog and Reviews. The Blog discusses ways we can turn our smartphone usage into a positive aspect of our lives, while also identifying some negative effects of the digital age, and ways we can overcome these. The Reviews section provides book reviews, which I am keen to continue as I believe reading physical books is a great way to escape from the digital world where the potential and temptation of connectivity is constant, yet rarely needed. </p>

			<h1> About the Design </h1>
			<p> Ecreviews.ie was designed by me, Eoin Cotter, as part of one of my college modules, <i>Advanced Web Development</i>. I am currently studying for a Bachelor of Commerce in University College Dublin, graduating in 2018. This is my first website and I found it a very enjoyable and challenging process. I look forward to advancing my web development skills in months and years to come.</p>
