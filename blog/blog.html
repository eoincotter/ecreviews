			<h1> How Addicted to Your Smartphone Are You?</h1>
			<p id = "post-date" > Posted by Eoin Cotter on 11/11/2017 </p> 
			<p> Certain aspects of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat are proven to stimulate the brain's 'happy' chemicals, such as Dopamine, Endorphin, Oxytocin and Serotonin. It is human instinct to chase things that cause an increase in these chemicals, and these can often be positive, like the burst of endorphins released after a workout. The desire for these rewarding stimuli is also the cause of addiction however, and it is arguable that the vast majority of young people in particular simply can't stop themselves from seeking these short-lived chemical bursts produced by superficial interactions on social media platforms. The links below provide more in-depth analysis of this topic and provide a test to determine your level of smartphone addcition.</p>

			<h1> Smartphones Enhancing Education in Under Developed Regions </h1>
			<p id = "post-date" > Posted by Eoin Cotter on 07/11/2017 </p> 
			<p> Poor levels of education has long been one of the underpinning factors influencing economic development. Many organisations today, such as The Khan Academy run by Salman Khan, are committed to providing free online education available to anyone in the world. Couple this with the surprising levels of smartphone ownership in underdeveloped regions, such as Africa and Central America, and perhaps this will be the beginning of the domocratisation of information and access to cheap education that is crucial in allowing an economy to thrive from the ground up. See the related links below for further reading on this topic and links to some of the organisations who are taking the lead in providing these platforms.</p>
