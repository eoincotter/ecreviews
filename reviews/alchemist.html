			<h1> The Alchemist </h1>
			<h3> By Paulo Coelho </h3>
			<p> Paulo Coelho's novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a number of influential peope - a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of pursuing hid dreams. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to overcome difficulties along the way. The story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</p>
			<p> Santiago’s dilemma is about the conflict between love and personal dreams, as he must decide whether to leave his loved ones behind and begin his quest. Too often we see a love relationship as the meaning of our life but the obsession with romantic coupling can cut us off from a life more connected with the rest of the world. Live your life around the dream, Coelho says, and there will be more ‘heart’ in your life than you can imagine: ‘No heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams’</p>
			<p> The story can move into religious territory at times, talking quite in depth about God and heaven etc, so depending on your own beliefs this could be a downside. However I think all people will be able to relate to the message of the story regardless of their religion. It is also importnant to note that the story was originally written in Portuguese, and later translated into English, so this may take away from the authenticity somewhat.</p>
