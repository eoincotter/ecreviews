			<h1> Elon Musk: The Biography </h1>
			<h3> By Ashlee Vance </h3>
			<p> <i>Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping Our Future</i> is an illuminating and authorized look at the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley’s most exciting, unpredictable, and ambitious entrepreneurs. Elon Musk is the renowned entrepreneur and innovator behind SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, who was also heavily involved in the early days of PayPal, which was ultimately sold to eBay for $1.5 billion. Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius’s life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa, his migration to the United States and his early beginnings in engineering and entrepreneurship to his current groundbreaking technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits. 
			Musk is a character that is truly loved and loathed. Interviews and anecdotes from the book display a number of characteristics in Musk which, due to his ruthless and stoic nature, leave many of his employees with few positive remarks to say about the man. However it is arguable that Musk has no choice but to maintain this in order to reach his sky-high ambitions. It cannot be denied that more than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.

Thorough and insightful, Elon Musk brings to life a technology industry that is rapidly and dramatically changing by examining the life of one of its most powerful and influential titans.</p>
